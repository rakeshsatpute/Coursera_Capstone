Specifically, this report will be targeted to stakeholders interested in opening an **Indian restaurant** in **Manhattan, New York City**.\n\nSince there are lots of restaurants in Manahattan we will try to detect locations that are not already crowded with restaurants. We are also particularly interested in areas with no Indian restaurants in vicinity. \n\nWe will use our data science powers to generate a few most promissing neighborhoods based on this criteria. Advantages of each area will then be clearly expressed so that best possible final location can be chosen by stakeholders."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "#### Data"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "Based on definition of our problem, factors that will influence our decission are:\n* number of existing restaurants in the neighborhood (any type of restaurant)\n* number of and distance to Indian restaurants in the neighborhood, if any\n\nWe decided to use regularly spaced grid of locations, centered around city center, to define our neighborhoods.\n\nFollowing data sources will be needed to extract/generate the required information:\n* centers of candidate areas will be generated algorithmically and approximate addresses of centers of those areas will be obtained using **Google Maps API reverse geocoding**\n* number of restaurants and their type and location in every neighborhood will be obtained using **Foursquare API**"}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
